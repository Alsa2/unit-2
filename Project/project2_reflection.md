# Project 2 Reflection
## 1. What were the challenges and most enjoyable parts of this project?

The hard was to cooperate with Bernard. Also making the graph was difficult, because with the data that we got on our sensor finding some useful information was hard. If we remove the graph part and the documentation we get programming, and this was my favorite and enjoyable par of this project.
## 2. What did you do different this time?

This time I started programming earlier than last time, also I dedicated les time for the code part and more for the graphs.
## 3. What did you learn?

I learned about the type of requests, and how to use them. I also learned how to use the matplotlib.
## 4. What are your goals for Unit 3/4?

My goal would be to keep up with the work and try to not do everything at the last occasion.
